# Revivar Assessment

This is an assessment project that allows users to design a personalized “thank you” card using images from Unsplash’s random image generator API. The site present the user with four randomly selected images to choose from. Once the user selects an image and enters their name, the website generates a custom card by overlaying the chosen image with the user’s name at the bottom and “Thank You” text at the top.
